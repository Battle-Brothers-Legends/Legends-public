As you pass a group of townsfolk gathered near a barrel of salted fish, you overhear snippets of their conversation. One woman, clutching a basket of bread, spoke in hushed tones.%SPEECH_ON%They say there\'s dragon slayer around, that killed a dragonâ€”right up in the northern hills, with nothing but his sword.%SPEECH_OFF%Her voice was thick with awe. A man next to her, shaking his head, muttered.%SPEECH_ON%Aye, I heard the same. Said it took three days to bring the beast down.%SPEECH_OFF%Another man scoffed. %SPEECH_ON%A dragon? Ridiculous!%SPEECH_OFF%The words stirred something in you. Dragon slayers werenâ€™t exactly common, and those who claimed such feats were often either liars or dead.
