Maybe it\'s just uninteresting, or maybe just the opposite. | One rumor of the man says he traveled the land as a magician. | Rumors of magic surround the man, though some incredulous cynics are hardly impressed. | One rumor is that he was a conman, and another is that he\'s a sorcerer. You\'re not sure which you prefer. | With rumors of dark arts being practiced once more, the man\'s magical proclamation just might be true. | Some say he eats toads for breakfast and black cats for dinner.} {You ask %name% a lot of questions, but through some handwaves and nods, you realize you have forgotten his answers. Or did you ask the questions at all? | %name% produces a dove from his sleeve. An old trick that fancies no one - until it turns in the air, returning to him as a crow. | %name% has shown the ability to shoot smoke from his mouth. It\'s not fire, but it\'s close, and has people talking in hushed tones. | %name% floats a gold coin into the air. An amazing display that leaves the man too tired to attempt it again. | Predictions of the weather are common, but %name% is unusually accurate with his own. | %name% asks to read your palms. You decline. His presence alone is as close as you\'re willing to go. | %name% suggests that the stars are a roadmap to another world. He seems to know a lot about the heavens above. | %name% suggests that the heavens above are in fact just endless streams of beings, continuing on for eons. What a jest! | %name% points to one star in the sky and seems to suggest that is where he came from. You don\'t ask for a clarification on the matter.}";
