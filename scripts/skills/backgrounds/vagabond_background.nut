Now he wanders with the last of his crowns jangling in a pocket. | Life on the road has taught %name% to be a jack of all trades, and a master of none - except walking, of course. | Not quite one for the city, and not quite one for the wild, %name% spends his purposeless days traveling between both. | During his drinking days, %name% managed to gamble away a small fortune. Now homeless, he simply wanders. | When his wife was murdered while he was away, %name% refused to sleep in the house. The man walks the earth, trying to forget the memory. | His son murdered five others. In shame, %name% abandoned his hometown to walk the earth and forget his failures as a father.} {But when a gang of thieves took all he had - including his shoes - he knew he needed yet another change. | But when he came to a literal fork in the road, the man realized he hadn\'t eaten in some time. His stomach demanded a change in scenery - and diet. | Sadly, the world is not a pleasant place for those who nobody would miss. He was harassed and bullied every day. | After one particularly harsh day trudging through mud, he realized there was no life to be had in walking around. | Strangely, one day he came across his long-forgotten brother he-never-had who said there was plenty of walking to be done for a mercenary outfit - and they\'d pay him to do it, too! | Like any good, impulsive man, he flipped a coin on whether or not to try his hand at mercenary work.} {He\'s not particularly good at anything, but %name% has seen and done a lot, and that\'s worth at least something. | Mucking about this violent land and surviving with all his limbs is a lot more than some folks can say. | A mercenary band would be but another adventure for a vagabond like %name%. One hopes he survives to write about it. | Through his travels his only weapon was a walking stick. Let\'s see how he does with something a smidge sharper. | A thief, a scoundrel, a baker, a tailor, %name%\'s done it all. Too bad he was never good at any of those things. Maybe it\'ll be different this time. | The world has been harsh to %name% for many years now. That isn\'t going to change, but at least he will be with brothers now.}";
