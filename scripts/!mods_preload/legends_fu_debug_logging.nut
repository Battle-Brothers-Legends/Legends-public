	NOTE: Saved FU Settings appear to deserialize towards the end of the game's deserialization process.
	This results in the following quirky behavior:
	- Given faction.nut prints logs tagged with "contractCategories" in addContract()
	- Given addContract() is called during the game's deserialization process (to load all the contracts)
	- Given an in-progress game was saved with FU Setting the debug flag for "contractCategories" to false
	- Given this script sets Value = true for ID = "contractCategories" in ::Const.LegendMod.Debug.FlagDefs
	- When we first load Battle Brothers and load the in-progress save:
	- Then addContract() will print the logs (meaning the flag "contractCategories"=true at this point) even though the save had the flag set to false 
	- Then, at a later stage of deserialization, FU Settings will deserialize
	- Then, after FU Settings have been deserialized, the flag "contractCategories"=false, and no more logging for addContract() will occur
	- Then, if we load the same save again, addContract() will not print logs, because now flag "contractCategories"=false 
	  (because of the FU Settings deserialization the first time we loaded the save)

	This means that no matter what the player has configured for the debug flags in FU Settings,
	whatever setting we configure in ::Const.LegendMod.Debug.FlagDefs will always take precedence when an existing save is loaded with the following circumstances:
	- First time the save was loaded and the player has not made any changes in Mod Settings since the Battle Brothers game was first booted up

	As soon as the player makes any change in Mod Settings to the Debug flag, this change is actually global (since it directly modifies the flag in Legends.Mod.Debug)
	and will take precedence until the player makes another change, or a save is finished loading, at which point the the saved FU setting will be loaded.

	To see how the value configured in this script might be contrasted against the value saved in Settings when loading a save, build and run Legends with the following code un-commented:
	// ::mods_hookExactClass("states/world_state", function(o){

	// 	local old_onDeserialize = o.onDeserialize;
	// 	o.onDeserialize = function( _in )
	// 	{
	// 		::logInfo("Value of Debug Flag for \"contractCategories\" at the START of deserialization: " + ::Legends.Mod.Debug.isEnabled(::Const.LegendMod.Debug.Flags.ContractCategories));
	// 		old_onDeserialize(_in);
	// 		::logInfo("Value of Debug Flag for \"contractCategories\" at the END of deserialization: " + ::Legends.Mod.Debug.isEnabled(::Const.LegendMod.Debug.Flags.ContractCategories));
	// 	}
	// });
