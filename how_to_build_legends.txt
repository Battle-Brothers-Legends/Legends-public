##How to build Legends##

1. Delete all the .brush files in the brushes directory (it will be recreated)
2. Delete all the matching brush images in the root of the gfx directory (they will be recreated). Do not delete the subdirectories
3. Delete all numbered directories under legend_helmets and legendarmor. Do not delete /entity/ or the root XML file
4. Run build_legends_mod.sh (the poss, mwah and rule versions change the directory and add extra steps)
5. This will produce both .nut files and compiled .cnut files.  To remove these, go the the output directory and run DEL /S /Q *.nut to remove the duplicates 
6. zip it up and you've got your build 


##Note when adding brushes## 
Adding images to the make_ scripts is not always enough. 
While it will create a new brush xml automatically when its reached the limit of images per sheet, it won't build those into brushes unless you also add a line to the build_brushes file
so if you add more images than fit in the current number of sheets,  or if you want to change the size of the sheets,   you can't just change the imagecount and run the whole build script.
you've got to:
1. change the imagecount in the make_armor script
2. delete your local numbered armor directories and xml files
3. run just the make script
4. check how many directories it created
5. update the build_brushes script to reference that number of directories

Only then can you run the whole build script
