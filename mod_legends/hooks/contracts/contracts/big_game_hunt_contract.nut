Splendid! Here is your pay, as agreed upon.%SPEECH_OFF% | You show the heads to %employer% who counts them with a wiggling finger and his lips whispering numbers. Finally, he straightens up.%SPEECH_ON%I don\'t have time for this shite. %randomname%, yes you servant, get over here and count these heads and pay the sellsword the agreed amount for each.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is eating an apple as he walks over to see what you\'ve returned with.
