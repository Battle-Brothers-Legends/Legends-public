I sent a lad, %randomname%\'s son, to go find them. And you know what? Only %their_employer% head came back. Of course, the idiot brigands sent one of their own to deliver it. We captured and interrogated him... so now we know where they\'re at.%SPEECH_OFF%The %person_employer% leans back, pedaling %their_employer% thumbs over one another in thought.%SPEECH_ON%I do not have the men, but I do have the crowns - what say I slip some your way, and you slip a sword theirs?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% pours %themselves_employer% a drink, stares at the cup, and pours %themselves_employer% some more. %They_employer% seems to drain it in one gulp before belching %their_employer% news.%SPEECH_ON%Brigands killed %randomname% and his whole family. Can you believe that? I know you don\'t know who they are, but they were a well-liked family in these parts. I\'m sure you can already imagine, but I want these brigands done with.

Are you interested?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is looking out a window, dancing a finger along the rim of a drink as %they_employer% weighs %their_employer% thoughts.%SPEECH_ON%Brigands have been taking off with precious livestock. They come in the night, the brigands I mean, and cut the bells to make off all quiet like. I\'m sure livestock aren\'t important to you, but one calf, one cow, one bull? That\'s a fortune to some people around these parts.\n\nSo the other day I have a lad follow the animal tracks out of town and now he\'s told me exactly where those brigands are. As I\'m sure you could guess, I don\'t have the men to spare to take these vagabonds on, but crowns... crowns I am not short on. If I were to cross your palms with copper, would you be willing to cross these brigands with steel?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% sighs as if %they're_employer% tired of all these troubles, as though %they're_employer% about to start a conversation %they're_employer% already had many times before.%SPEECH_ON%%randomname%, a man of some import here, states that brigands made a pass on his daughters. Now he\'s worried what they\'ll do the next time. Luckily, that man is of some wealth and could easily track these brigands down. If I were to pay you a decent sum, how earnestly could you drive one of them swords of yours through a brigand or two?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% takes a seat in a chair big enough to be comfortable for two. %They_employer% bandies a mug back and forth.%SPEECH_ON%Brigands have been harrying us for weeks now and just yesterday they tried to set fire to a pub. Can you believe that? Who sets fire to such a thing? Luckily we put it out just in time, but things are getting bad around here. If they threaten our precious drink, what will they do next? Luckily, we managed to find where these vagrants are hiding. So... yes I see your look. It\'s a simple task, sellsword: we want you to go kill every last brigand there. Are you willing to work with us?%SPEECH_OFF% | As you settle into the room, %employer% finishes a goblet of cobra wine and heaves the cup out a window. You hear the din of it clattering hollow far, far away. %They_employer% turns to you.%SPEECH_ON%While walking the roads, brigands swarmed my wagon and made off with all my goods! They left me my life, which is fine, but the gall of what they did keeps me up at night. I see their sneering faces... hear their laughter... I believe it was a message, to go after me, because I refused to pay their \'tolls\'. Well, now I am ready to pay a toll - to you, sellsword. If you go and slaughter these vagabonds, I\'ll pay a tidy toll indeed. What say you?%SPEECH_OFF% | As you begin to take a seat, %employer% throws a scroll at you. It unfurls just as you catch it. You begin to read, but %employer% starts in with the news anyway.%SPEECH_ON%Traders from %randomtown% have all agreed to no longer patronize %townname% until our little brigand problem is done away with. The history of it is pretty simple, as I\'m sure you\'re aware of the brigands\' methods, but these damn vagabonds have been harrying the roads, pillaging caravans and killing merchants.\n\nI know exactly where they are, I just need a man of guts and in need of glory - or gold! - to go and kill them. So what say you, mercenary? Name a price and we can talk.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is shaking when you greet %them_employer%. %They're_employer% practically frothing with anger - or maybe %they're_employer% just really drunk.%SPEECH_ON%Citizens of this fine town are starving. Why? Because brigands keep sneaking in during the night to raid the granaries! And if we catch them, they burn the buildings down! Now we can\'t defend ourselves by sitting back... Now... I want to defend myself by killing them all.%SPEECH_OFF%The man teeters for a moment, as if about to spill %themselves_employer% across %their_employer% desk. %They_employer% steadies before continuing.%SPEECH_ON%I want you to go kill these vagrants, obviously. All you have to do is be interested and... -hic-... name your price.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% looks solemnly at the ground. %They_employer% unfurls a scroll, showing you a face.%SPEECH_ON%This is %randomname%, a brigand at large who we captured the other day. He once lead an outfit of vagrants that used to harry and raid our town day and night. Problem is, he\'s not really the head of a snake, but one head of a hydra. Kill one criminal head, another takes its place. So what\'s the answer? Why, kill them ALL of course. And that\'s exactly what I want you to do, sellsword. Are you interested?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% turns to you as you look for somewhere to sit.%SPEECH_ON%Hoy, mercenary, how long has it been since you\'ve slaked your sword with the blood of evil, cruel men?%SPEECH_OFF%%They_employer% drops the sarcasm and you figure you\'ll be standing now.%SPEECH_ON%We here at %townname% are having a bit of a tiff with some local brigands. Local to us, that is, with their little rat\'s hole not far from here. Obviously, I think the answer to this issue is to hire some finely armed men such as your little company of goodfellas.
