Crouching down, you see that %their_woundedbrother% eyes are dimmed and %they_woundedbrother% does not respond to questions. %Their_woundedbrother %chest rises and falls to uneven breathing. You peel back the dressings over %their_woundedbrother% %wound% to reveal green, sickly flesh. | %woundedbrother% is laughing with the rest of the men when %they_woundedbrother% suddenly falls over with %their_woundedbrother% eyes going to the back of %their_woundedbrother% head. The rest of the men rush to %their_woundedbrother% aid.%SPEECH_ON%Sir, %their_woundedbrother% wound\'s beyond sore.%SPEECH_OFF%The flesh around %their_woundedbrother% %wound% has gotten pulpy, slathered with dead skin and the pulsing viridian of infections ready to be sloughed off. | %woundedbrother%\'s %wound% has gotten infected. The flesh around the injury is black and that which has color is green, both very bad signs. | Infection is settling into %woundedbrother%\'s %wound%. There\'s no saying if he\'ll survive or not, but either way %they_woundedbrother%\'s going to be in bad shape for a time. | You come to find %woundedbrother% leaning against a tree. He\'s shaking and saliva is dropping from %their_woundedbrother% lips.%SPEECH_ON%I\'m alright, sir. My %wound%\'s just... a little infected. Give me time, I\'ll get better.%SPEECH_OFF%You purse your lips. Perhaps %they_woundedbrother%\'ll get better on %their_woundedbrother% own, but %they_woundedbrother%\'ll be hardly in fighting shape if %they_woundedbrother% goes without care. | %woundedbrother% is no longer in sound fighting shape. %Their_woundedbrother% wounds have gotten infected. Without immediate care, it may take some time for %them_woundedbrother% to get back into fighting shape. | %woundedbrother% stumbles into your tent. %They_woundedbrother% coughs into the crook of %their_woundedbrother% elbow and a stringy bit of saliva trails between it and %their_woundedbrother% lips.%SPEECH_ON%Ah shit, sorry sir. I\'m uh, I think I\'m a little sick.%SPEECH_OFF%Taking a look at %them_woundedbrother%, you surmise that %their_woundedbrother% wounds have gotten infected. %They_woundedbrother% may still be able to fight, but you probably shouldn\'t risk that until %they_woundedbrother% gets better. | While the company eats around a campfire, %woundedbrother% suddenly vomits. You see that there\'s sweat all over %their_woundedbrother% brow and %their_woundedbrother% eyes are a bit dazed. %otherbrother% shakes %their_otherbrother% head.%SPEECH_ON%Sir, %their_woundedbrother% wounds have gotten infected.%SPEECH_OFF%The wounded brother sails back into the grass, arms pawing the air.%SPEECH_ON%I\'m fine, ya gits. I\'ll fight the lot of you.%SPEECH_OFF%%their_woundedbrother% balled fists pedal back and forth before %they_woundedbrother% slides into a deep sleep. Yeah, %they_woundedbrother%\'s probably not gonna be battle ready for awhile. | Battles take a toll on men, and sometimes they survive wounds that come back to get them. %woundedbrother% is such a %person_woundedbrother% - infection from injuries has spread about %their_woundedbrother% body. He\'s very sick and should not fight unless absolutely necessary. | With each battle, a mercenary risks death. With each injury, %they_woundedbrother% risks infection. %woundedbrother% has received the latter and it just may preempt the former. %their_woundedbrother% wounds have become black and where they aren\'t black they are green. He\'s able to walk, but should probably be kept out of the frontlines until %they_woundedbrother% gets better. | A man may survive a battle with terrible wounds, but it only starts another battle against infection. %woundedbrother%\'s injuries have gotten worse and may need time to heal. Unless absolutely necessary, %they_woundedbrother% should be kept out of the frontlines. | %woundedbrother%\'s injuries have gotten worse, possibly infected. Some suggest maggots to help clear out the infection, while others hint at amputations and more drastic measures. As far as you\'re concerned, you simply need to give it time. That said, the mercenary should probably be kept out of the fights until %they_woundedbrother% gets better.}";
