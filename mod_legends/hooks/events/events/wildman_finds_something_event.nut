Holding your fist up to quiet the company, the forest returns your order of silence with muted chirps of distant birds and the buzz of a bee or wasp somewhere unseen. Shaking your head, you decide to continue the march.\n\nA few hours later, the wildling jumps out of a bush you were about to cleave with a machete. %wildman% has got an armful of random items in hand. Where these things came from, you\'ve no idea, but you have the mercenaries sift through the findings. %wildman% returns to rank as though nothing happened at all. You glance at the wildling who\'s staring at their finger where a butterfly has landed. When you glance again, the butterfly is gone and the wildling is swallowing something. %otherguy% gives you a report on what was brought.";
