Masked by green silk, nearly see through, and clothed in thin silks with the whole midriff exposed, the dancer is no doubt an expert in her field. She whirls, hips hypnotic, elbows bowed, hands clapping little cymbals, her feet tiptoeing as she spins a spot so tight there very well may be an invisible god above holding her in place as she razzles and dazzles.\n\n Someone throws an apple through the air and the dancer spins around and shoots a tiny dagger through it, plugging it dead center and dropping the fruit to the ground. Another apple soars in and this time a large saber is produced and slashes the stem off and she catches the rest and takes a bite. The crowd claps gently to this.}";

She claps the cymbals in your face, then swings around, briefly bumping you with her hips, and starts to dance back to the middle.

She goes bowlegged and sinks to the ground like a collapsing truss. She counts her crowns.%SPEECH_ON%I\'m not sure if you have a good eye for the wandering nature of ones such as myself.

Just at that moment, a leering passerby struts over and attempts to clutch her by her hips.
