Form check!%SPEECH_OFF%%gl1% yells while mid-squat. %gl2% rushes over and palms the gladiator\'s buttocks and yells \'go!\'. The gladiator dips the squat far past ninety degrees.%SPEECH_ON%It\'s tight!%SPEECH_OFF%%gl2% confirms.%SPEECH_ON%How tight?%SPEECH_OFF%%gl2% takes a hand back, balls into a fist, and punches the gladiator\'s ass. %gl2%\' hand flails back and forth like it touched a hot pan.%SPEECH_ON%Tighter than a Vizier\'s purse!%SPEECH_OFF%%gl1% finishes the squat and stands up and they chest bump.%SPEECH_ON%Your turn! Let\'s gooo!%SPEECH_OFF% | %SPEECH_ON%Hey. Look at this.%SPEECH_OFF%%gl1%\'s chest bounces, one boob at a time. You mention it is impressive and move on, but %gl1% grabs you.%SPEECH_ON%They\'re pecs. And they\'re beautiful. Hey. Say they\'re beautiful.%SPEECH_OFF%One tit bumps, and then the other, back and forth.

In one night.%SPEECH_OFF%%gl1% laughs and asks if they were all women. %gl2% hesitates.%SPEECH_ON%Well, there were a couple men there. But who knows which part belongs to whom. We got close though, cause at one point he was down there, and I was positioned like this behind-%SPEECH_OFF%You walk over clapping, not in applause but to tell the gladiators to stay focused. You understand the roads can be long and boring, but this is getting ridiculous. | %gl1% flexes a biceps.%SPEECH_ON%I could snap a mule\'s neck with one arm.%SPEECH_OFF%Head shaking, %gl2% asks why flex both arms then. %gl1%\'s head cocks in return.%SPEECH_ON%Well obviously I plan to kill two mules at the same time.%SPEECH_OFF%You interrupt, telling the gladiators they won\'t be killing any animals until they complete the %companyname%\'s primary tasks which is only sometimes to kill animals. | %gl1% sits beside %gl2% and turns away while saying.%SPEECH_ON%Put your hand on my spine.

I can hear my hand bones cracking!%SPEECH_OFF%You think to interrupt, but technically nobody is hurt... yet. You leave the gladiators to their, eh, proclivities. | %SPEECH_START%So I had my lover over the fruit cart like this and we\'re just having a grand old time when their father walks in. He stands all slackjawed and can hardly get a word out.%SPEECH_OFF%%gl1% nods.%SPEECH_ON%So I says to him, watch this.

That\'s a buncha lies!%SPEECH_OFF%The gladiator holds a hand up.%SPEECH_ON%By the light of the Gilder, and whatever other gods may deem to gawk at my body, it is the truth.
