The owner goes for his dog, but it slips out his grasp as though his arms were but another snake and it sprints right to your side. You ask if it\'s his dog at all. He nods, then slowly shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%I suppose it\'s yer dog now. He\'s a fighter, that one, but he ain\'t nothing at all if not a goddam shite swimmer.

But I ain\'t ever would need to train a dog to beware this here bog, which means this sonuvabitch here threw him in there, ain\'t that right?%SPEECH_OFF%The stranger\'s first words are excuses and so the houndmaster batters him. The stranger scissors his legs backwards so awkwardly his pants fall about his ankles and there in his drawers spill an assortment of treasures. The damned fool is a treasure hunter! %houndmaster% draws a weapon and looks ready to murder this man.

Finally, the beast hunter draws a dinner knife and slashes it into the water. Once more. And again. The dog surfaces and it snorts for air. The slayer stabs again and this time the dog runs free and goes between your legs where it huddles wet and whimpering. %beastslayer% holds something in hand and then lets it go, whatever it is diving across the swamp, the water rippling in its wake.%SPEECH_ON%Nothing but a snake, captain.%SPEECH_OFF%The beast slayer kicks a foot up out of the water and riding on a toe is a shiny goblet. The slayer regards the swamp stranger with complete contempt.%SPEECH_ON%Your cowardice has made you a monster, treasure hunter, a right savage that\'d use a dog in place of his own two hands.
