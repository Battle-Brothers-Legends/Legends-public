Her eyes gleam and study the art covering the amphora. She whispers to herself a few things, but you only make out %SPEECH_ON%I thought I had lost you...%SPEECH_OFF% Without warning, she drips her finger into the mulch and sucks on it. You wait for a reaction but none comes, she either has tasted worse or hides her pain very well. She places the jug down and locks eyes with you. %SPEECH_ON%You have a problem, I know of this item and have come across it before - but it is not how I remember it. The mixture inside has spoiled, which I did not think was possible until now. It has long passed it\'s orginal purpose and I cannot guarantee what you will be drinking each time this refills.%SPEECH_OFF% She takes a sip from the vessel, and instantly pales and spits it out with a force that could blind a man.}";

At first the speed of which is rapid, but after a time she freezes and starts from the beginning again, reading very carefully and methodically between what appears to be blank pages. Minutes pass as she digests the information on each page before moving on. After a dozen pages, the reading becomes faster and she finally flicks through the last pages all the way to end end. %SPEECH_ON%Interesting, but not finished. I liked the part about the mackrel and the bucket.%SPEECH_OFF% Your mind begins to wander, is this another trick? She smiles at you wryly and folds her arms. %SPEECH_ON%It\'s blank for you, isn\'t it? I have read about this book before. It often trades hands because the owner doesn\'t like to be reminded of how uncontrollable their life is each time they pass their bookshelf. They think that passing on Van Hoorst\'s \'hronolosko ludilo\' will bring them back control. This is only one of five volumes, this is volume four, I believe.%SPEECH_OFF% The woman flicks through a few more of the pages again, possibly trying to discern if this conversation has had any impact on her end. She closes the book carefully and slides it across the table to you. %SPEECH_ON%Regardless, you should know that anyone who holds this is playing a risky game. Many think that the books alter fate themselves, not just reveal it. Those who die with these books in hand often do so with no chance at recovery. Some have said that they have seen men bleed to death from a pinprick because the book willed it so.%SPEECH_OFF%}";

With that, she closes the ledger a final time and throws it back at you, which you only just manage to catch. %SPEECH_ON%Boring!%SPEECH_OFF% She attends to a cooking pot starting to boil. %SPEECH_ON%I have seen these before, they\'re ledgers to track debtors and indebted alike. I know none of these names or what they mean but I do know the symbols in the margins.%SPEECH_OFF% She sips the soup from a spoon, and throws the spoon back into the pot the way a squirrel would discard a spent acorn. %SPEECH_ON%Symbols like \'Dead\' or \'Missing\', but there is one in there which is more broad - \'Taken\'. Be whom or what I am unsure, but based on the age of that skin and the names I think you found a relic of the Fallen Empire. Have you seen those packs of bones out there? Pretending like nothing is wrong despite being a magnet for wild and hungry dogs who don\'t know any better? They were a superstitious lot and even in death, they still are.

You think you catch the paw twitching, but it could just be her movement making it sway. %SPEECH_ON%Good for vigor, gives you that energy you need to run through the woods...or more.%SPEECH_OFF% She flashes you a wry smile and looks you up and down.
