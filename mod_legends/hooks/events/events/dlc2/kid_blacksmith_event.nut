It starts to crumple sideways and the kid rushes to catch it if only to stem the tide of trouble which has beset his day. The insane weight pastes him flat against the cobblestones, his limbs briefly stretched up like a cricket smooshed beneath a thumb. You see this all from a distance and whistle for the mercenary to head back before there\'s trouble. %They_other% makes his escape just as a few passersby start to take notice. %They_other% shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%We didn\'t do nothing, right sir?%SPEECH_OFF%You nod.}";

They throw plenty of coin in, and the applause is deafening as %they_juggler% plays out his final act of five maces at the same time.

I want no business with that %person_killer% and would sooner seek a blacksmith\'s hiding than see %them_killer% ever again. You take the weapon, you keep %them_killer% away. Deal? Deal, yeah?
