And then another. The wildling glares at you, but you slowly produce a stick with a frilly bow tied to the top. Its whirly nature captures the wildling\'s eye. When %wildman% reaches out for it, you draw it back and shake your head. You then point at the crowns, and then at the stick.%SPEECH_ON%One for the other, yes?%SPEECH_OFF%The wildman looks at the crowns, mulling them over like an accountant, but you know their thoughts are far more chaotic than that. Suddenly, %wildman% growls and pushes the crowns forward and takes the stick away from you. Looks like the trade is done.";

Slowly, you put the coin down and then produce a stick with a string wrapped around its top. %wildman% stare slackens, the sturdy stick a slick treat to the unkempt wildling. You motion that you\'ll give it in exchange for the crowns. %wildman% takes the stick. You take the crowns.\n\n But when the wildling plays with the string, it falls off and blows away in the wind. %wildman% cries out, then stares murderously at you, yourself standing there with both arms barreled to try and hold all the crowns. The wildling screams. You drop the crowns and run as fast as you can. There is all manner of chaos going on behind you - tools and weapons being broke, mercenaries running for their lives, and the absolute bedlam of a bunch of confused people beset by a wildling - but you dare not look.";
