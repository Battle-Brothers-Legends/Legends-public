The roots go through the earth and into the realm of the gods. It is said they once listened, but now... we are not so sure.%SPEECH_OFF%You stare at the %person_monk%, and %their_monk% particularly withheld posture, and ask if %they_monk% fears the tree. %They_monk% smiles at you and shakes %their_monk% head.%SPEECH_ON%I respect it like a man would the sea, for the waters of the oceans hold many things to fear and, yet, the sailor sails anyway.
