So %they% stole from them both and gave to %themselves%. | %name%\'s father taught %them% all there was to know about stealing including, unfortunately, how to backstab. | The church steals with a silver plate. The lords do it with the taxman. So %name% figured why can\'t %they% do it with %their% own two hands? | Impoverished while growing up, %name% took to stealing bread. Well-fed, %they% soon took to stealing crowns.} {After years of successful stealing, one mistake landed %name% in a dungeon. Thankfully, years of stealing also meant years of lockpicking and %they% didn\'t spend long. | But when %they% was caught trying to steal a temple\'s chalice, a talk with a priest convinced %name% to perhaps take a different path. | Unfortunately, a smash-and-grab at a local store ended with %name% being caught red-handed. %They% was soon profiled on posters everywhere, making %their% work difficult. | Daring to cut the purse of a fat trader, %name% soon found %themselves% nursing a hand absent of a few fingers. %They% really liked those fingers, too. | %name%\'s thievery eventually placed %them% at the head of an entire guild. But after a dozen failed assassination attempts, the thief realized there was nobody to trust in %their% line of work. | Partnering up with a beautiful woman, %name% managed to steal from everybody. Too bad the woman stole from %them%, in the end. | Trying to sell some goods, a trusted fence turned out to be a traitorous informant. One bad pillory experience later and the thief was exiled from %randomtown%. | It was the perfect heist. That\'s all that is said about it. Now, %name% just needs to lay low. | Tortured by a rival gang, %they% came to miss a number of teeth, fingernails, and any drive to return to thieving. | %Their% time as a thief came to an end when, arrested, %they% spent five days pilloried during tomato season. | Naturally, it wasn\'t long until %they% went to prison. %They% doesn\'t speak of %their% time there, but it is obvious %they% wishes to never return. | But one day %they% learned there are much better ways to spin a blade for a coin than petty thievery. | But %their% half-brother was captured by a local gang, forcing the thief to find new ways to pay the hefty ransom. | But life as a brigand is not easy. Arrested for eating a chicken that was not %theirs%, the %person% forfeited two fingers and any will to keep thieving. | After a heist went south, the %person% fingered all %their% former partners to save %their% own hide. Now %they% can never go back to thieving.} {For all you know %name% is just using sellswords to hide behind. Regardless of %their% reasons, he\'s still going to have to earn %their% pay. | You recognize %name% from some posters.  Well, a %person% who has gotten this far without being caught must have some value. | With one hand, %name% twirls a blade between %their% fingers. With the other, %they% snags your purse. Impressive. Now give it back. | Years of thieving have made %name% adept at escaping trouble. | %name% has the skills to be a good mercenary, just be sure to watch your purse while around %them%. | You can\'t trust a %person% like %name%, but that attribute has plenty of company anyway. | Supposedly, somebody once shot an arrow at %name%. They missed, but the thief kept the feathers. | %name%\'s effort to join sellswords better not be a scheme to steal from your coffers. | Wanted posters say %name% is considered \'armed and dangerous\'. Perfect. | There are plenty of lawmen looking for %name%. Maybe you can get them to join, too.}";
