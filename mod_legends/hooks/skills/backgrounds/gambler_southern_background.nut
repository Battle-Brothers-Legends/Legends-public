Then again, maybe it\'s good that he sees your group as a smart gamble. | Perhaps years of scamming mercenaries has given him the notion that he could just as easily be one. | Clever and quick-thinking, the cardshaper survives by moving before anyone else does, a skill as useful as any other in this world. | Ironically, a bad play put him into enormous debt with a baron. Now he has to find another way to pay it back. | Wars have sapped most of the fish from his cards games. Instead of waiting around he figured he\'d just go ahead and follow them.}";
